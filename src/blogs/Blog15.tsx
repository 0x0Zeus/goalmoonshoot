        What is an IRA? A Quick Overview
      </h2>
      <p className="text-justify">
        An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) is a special savings account designed to help you save for retirement. There are a few types of IRAs, each with different benefits and tax advantages.
      </p>

        The three main types we’ll discuss and compare are:

        1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold IRA: Investing in Precious Metals for Stability
      </h2>
      <h3 className="mt-5 text-lg font-bold">What Is a Gold IRA? What Makes It Different?</h3>
      <p className="text-justify">
        A Gold IRA is a type of self-directed IRA that allows you to invest in physical gold, silver, platinum, or palladium. Unlike traditional and Roth IRAs, which typically hold stocks and bonds, a Gold IRA focuses on tangible assets. Many people choose Gold IRAs as a way to protect their savings against inflation and economic instability.

      <h3 className="mt-5 text-lg font-bold">Key Benefits of a Gold IRA</h3>
      <ul className="ml-10 list-disc list-outside">

          <span className="font-bold">
            Inflation Hedge:{" "}
          </span>
          Gold has historically held its value, especially during periods of inflation.
        </li>
        <li className="text-justify">
          <span className="font-bold">Portfolio Diversification: </span>
          Gold and other precious metals provide a level of security that can help balance the volatility of stocks.
        </li>
        <li className="text-justify">
          <span className="font-bold">Physical Asset: </span>
          With a Gold IRA, you own actual, physical gold stored in a secure, IRS-approved depository.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="mt-5 text-lg font-bold">Tax Advantages of a Gold IRA</h3>
      <p className="text-justify">
        Like traditional IRAs, contributions to a Gold IRA may be tax-deductible if you meet certain income requirements. However, taxes on gains are deferred until you withdraw from the account.
      </p>
      <h2 className="mt-5 text-2xl font-bold">
        2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditional IRA: A Popular Choice for Tax Benefits
      </h2>
      <h3 className="mt-5 text-lg font-bold">What Is a Traditional IRA?</h3>
      <p className="text-justify">
        A Traditional IRA allows you to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. This means that your contributions may be tax-deductible, and your money grows tax-free until you withdraw it in retirement. Traditional IRAs are a popular choice because they provide immediate tax relief.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mt-5 text-lg font-bold">Key Benefits of a Traditional IRA</h3>
      <ul className="ml-10 list-disc list-outside">

            Tax-Deferred Growth:{" "}

          Your investments grow tax-free until your retirement. This means it can lead to more significant growth over time.

        <li className="text-justify">
          <span className="font-bold">Immediate Tax Benefits: </span>
          Contributions are often deductible, lowering your taxable income.

        <li className="text-justify">
          <span className="font-bold">Wide Range of Investment Options: </span>
          Traditional IRAs allow you to invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and more.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="mt-5 text-lg font-bold">Tax Considerations for a Traditional IRA</h3>
      <p className="text-justify">
        With a traditional IRA, you pay taxes on your withdrawals during retirement. In other words your distributions are taxed as ordinary income. Required minimum distributions (RMDs) start at age 73, meaning you must start withdrawing funds each year.

        Roth IRA: Tax-Free Withdrawals for Future Savings
      </h2>
      <h3 className="mt-5 text-lg font-bold">What Is a Roth IRA?</h3>
      <p className="text-justify">
        A Roth IRA is a retirement account funded with after-tax dollars, meaning you don’t get an immediate tax break when you contribute. However, qualified withdrawals in retirement are completely tax-free, making Roth IRAs an attractive option for younger investors who expect to be in a higher tax bracket later in life.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mt-5 text-lg font-bold">Key Benefits of a Roth IRA</h3>

        </li>
        <li className="text-justify">
          <span className="font-bold">No RMDs (Required minimum distributions): </span>
