      Gold’s Resilience in Times of Economic Turmoil
      </h3>
      <p className="text-justify">
      Historically, gold has demonstrated its strength as a stable store of value, especially in times of economic instability. In fact, recent insights from GOLDEXCG highlight how inflationary periods tend to drive up the demand for gold. For example, the 1970s saw inflation rise sharply, with average interest rates climbing from 5.84% in 1970 to 13.58% by 1980. Meanwhile, gold prices soared, climbing from $35 per ounce to $850, illustrating its resilience when the dollar weakens.

      Why Gold’s Value Stays Strong When Inflation Rises
      </h3>
      <p className="text-justify">
      Gold holds its value because, unlike paper currency, it is a finite resource. When inflation outpaces interest rate increases, investing in gold during inflation can protect wealth in ways cash and bonds cannot. According to research by the World Gold Council, when inflation accelerates faster than interest rates, commodities like gold can often outperform other financial assets. And while economic conditions shift over time, gold’s intrinsic value has historically made it a go-to investment for wealth preservation.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mt-5 text-xl font-bold">
      Demand for Gold as the Dollar’s Value Falls
      </h3>
      <p className="text-justify">
      In periods of high inflation, the dollar loses value, which can lead people to seek alternatives like gold. The Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate hikes haven’t fully kept up with rising inflation, leading many to consider investing in precious metals. Gold’s stability makes it attractive, and its price stability in inflation provides a hedge when traditional investments may falter. With the dollar’s buying power on the decline, gold becomes even more appealing as a way to protect long-term wealth.

Gold doesn’t directly correlate with stocks or bonds, meaning it can provide a cushion when other parts of the market are down. Many investors keep a portion of their portfolio in gold and other precious metals to offset losses and ensure a measure of security.

        Is Gold Better Than Fiat Currency in Protecting Wealth?
      </h3>
      <p className="text-justify">
        Unlike fiat currency, which loses value during inflation, gold remains a tangible asset with intrinsic value. Gold vs fiat currency shows a marked difference in times of inflation, as gold is not directly impacted by currency devaluation.

        Can Gold Prices Fall During Inflation?
      </h3>

        While gold has historically performed well during inflation, there are no guarantees. Market conditions, supply and demand, and investor sentiment all impact gold prices.
